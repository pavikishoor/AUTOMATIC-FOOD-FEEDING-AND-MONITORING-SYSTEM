# AUTOMATIC-FOOD-FEEDING-AND-MONITORING-SYSTEM

ABSTRACT

An automatic fish feeder is a device that automatically feed the fish at a
predetermined time. In a way, it is to control the fish feeding activity by using a
fish feeder that combined the mechanical system and electrical system to form a
device instead of manually feeding the fish by hand. Fish owners whom are away
for a long time will have trouble knowing the situation of thepond or aquarium.
At the set timing the automatic fish feeder will feed the fish . The device will feed
the fish by dropping the feed from the storage through a hole. The size of the hole
is controlled by a piece of block connected to a motor. A timer is used to control
the number of feeding time at an interval of time.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

In modern times, some of the fish owners were facing major issues in feeding their fish on
time, during their out of town period. Owners cannot carry their fish to all places and fish need
to be fed on time to survive and remain healthy. At the regular interval of time if fish don’t
give the proper food, then there will be starvation. But at the same time if we give too much
food, then food gunge up will remain in the water and the owner needs to spend more time in
the cleaning.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE ENHANCEMEN APPENDICES
Implementing an IoT based system that controls the whole aquarium automatically and
providing real-time status on the user’s dashboard. It contains water quality management in
which it will monitor the physical changes in the water and will maintain it to the ideal
conditions, with required changes. The aquarium will perform all the steps automatically like
temperature control, turbidity level control, light monitor, feeding, water renewal, etc.
