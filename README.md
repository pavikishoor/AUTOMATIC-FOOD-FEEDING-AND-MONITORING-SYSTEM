# AUTOMATIC-FOOD-FEEDING-AND-MONITORING-SYSTEM

ABSTRACT

An automatic fish feeder is a device that automatically feed the fish at a
predetermined time. In a way, it is to control the fish feeding activity by using a
fish feeder that combined the mechanical system and electrical system to form a
device instead of manually feeding the fish by hand. Fish owners whom are away
for a long time will have trouble knowing the situation of thepond or aquarium.
At the set timing the automatic fish feeder will feed the fish . The device will feed
the fish by dropping the feed from the storage through a hole. The size of the hole
is controlled by a piece of block connected to a motor. A timer is used to control
the number of feeding time at an interval of time.
